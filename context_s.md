**9:15 AM - Sarah Jackson**
👋 Good morning, team! Reminder: we have our **weekly design sync at 11 AM**. Let’s make sure we have all updates ready. If anyone has new wireframes or designs, please upload them here beforehand!

---

**9:16 AM - Dave Kim**
Got it, Sarah! I'm still finalizing the **UI for the dashboard view** but should have something ready by the meeting.

---

**9:17 AM - Laura Chen**
Morning! I'll upload the revised **user flow diagrams** shortly. Had a few ideas on simplifying the onboarding process that I’d love to get feedback on.

---

**9:20 AM - Sarah Jackson**
Sounds good, thanks, Laura! The simpler, the better. 🙌

**9:21 AM - Tom Edwards**
Hey everyone, I’ve been working on the **prototype for the mobile interface**. Just a heads-up, I ran into some challenges with the transition animations on smaller screens. I'll share a demo video here in a bit to show where I’m stuck.

---

**9:24 AM - Sarah Jackson**
Good call, Tom. Let’s brainstorm that in the meeting. Transition issues are pretty common on mobile, so we’ll figure something out.

Here's the video showing the **animation issues on mobile**.

It’s mainly noticeable between screens 2 and 3—feels a bit choppy. Appreciate any suggestions!

**9:38 AM - Sarah Jackson**
Just watched it—thanks for uploading, Tom. It seems like a rendering delay. Maybe we could try **reducing the asset file sizes** or tweaking the frame rate?

---

**9:42 AM - Laura Chen**
@TomEdwards Agreed with Sarah. Lowering the frame rate might help without impacting user experience. I’ve had success with that in past projects.

---

**9:45 AM - Tom Edwards**
Awesome, thanks, @SarahJackson and @LauraChen! I’ll give that a try and update you all before the meeting.

---

**9:50 AM - Dave Kim**
Also, I’ve just uploaded the latest **dashboard wireframes**.

**3:30 PM - Dave Kim**
Hey team, quick question on **iconography**—are we sticking with our default icon set, or should we explore new options? I have a couple of alternatives if anyone wants to see them.

---

**3:32 PM - Sarah Jackson**
Great question. Let’s explore some new options! Can you share the ones you have, Dave?

---

**3:35 PM - Dave Kim**
Sure thing!

*uploads files*
📂 **Icon_Set_Option1.fig**
📂 **Icon_Set_Option2.fig**

Here are two options I think would work well. Option 1 is closer to our current style, but Option 2 has a bit more character.

---

**3:37 PM - Laura Chen**
I like Option 2! It’s fresh but still professional.

---

**3:38 PM - Tom Edwards**
Option 2 gets my vote too. Feels a bit more modern.

---

**3:40 PM - Sarah Jackson**
Looks like we’re all leaning toward Option 2. Great choice, team! Let’s go with that one.
